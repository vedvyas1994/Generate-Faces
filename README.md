## Project: Generate Faces using DCGAN

### By Vedavyas Kamath

### Goal/Aim
To define and train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adersarial Network (DCGAN) on a dataset of faces such that the generator network is able to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

### Dataset:
I have used the [Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train the Discriminator & Generator networks of my DCGAN. Since the project's main focus is on building and training the DCGAN, I have used a pre-processed version of the data available for download [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/November/5be7eb6f_processed-celeba-small/processed-celeba-small.zip). In the downloaded zip, each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. 

### Project Overview
This project has been completed under a single Jupyter notebook and the details of tasks performed in the same are listed below :

**Notebook : dlnd_face_generation.ipynb**
* Unzip, Load & explore the data.
* Batch the data, transform and create a dataloader. Also define a function that can be used to scale our values to a differnt range if required.
* Define the Discriminator & Generator networks with forrward pass, back-propagation functions, loss functions and optimizers for each network to be used while training and testing.
* Define the initial weights, set hyper-parameters and define the training and testing functions to be finally called to train/evaluate the model.
* Visualise the training loss and finally print out the new images generated by the model.


### Software Requirements
This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
- [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)


NOTE: <br>
This dataset is quite complex and so it is reccomended to utilize a GPU for training.
